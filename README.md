Enpal Solar Surplus Integration with cFos Charging Manager

This repository contains a Python script that fetches solar power surplus data from an Enpal InfluxDB and serves it via an HTTP endpoint. This data can be used to integrate with the cFos Charging Manager to enable surplus charging.

Prerequisites

Python 3.11 or later
Docker
Git
Raspberry Pi (or any other Linux-based system)
Installation

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enpal-solar-surplus.git
```

Step 2: Copy and Configure the Start Script
Copy the start_enpal.sh script to a directory above the cloned repository:

```bash
cp enpal-solar-surplus/start_enpal.sh ..
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ../start_enpal.sh
```

Edit the start_enpal.sh script to add the necessary environment variables:

```bash
nano ../start_enpal.sh
```

Add the following environment variables to the script:

INFLUXDB_URL
INFLUXDB_TOKEN
INFLUXDB_ORG
INFLUXDB_BUCKET
Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container
Navigate back to the cloned repository directory and build the Docker container:

```bash
cd enpal-solar-surplus
docker build -t enpal-solar-surplus .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name enpal-solar enpal-solar-surplus
```

This will build and start the Docker container, running the Flask application that serves the solar power surplus data.

Step 4: Configure cFos Charging Manager
Access the cFos Charging Manager Configuration:

Navigate to the cFos Charging Manager web interface.
Go to the "Configuration" section.
Add the User-Defined Meter:

Select "User-defined meters" from the configuration options.
Click on "Add new meter" and choose "HTTP/JSON" as the meter type.
Upload the Enpal_Surplus_Meter.json file you created.
Set Up a Solar Surplus Charging Rule:

Go to the "Charging Rules" section in the cFos Charging Manager.
Add a new rule and select "Surplus Charging" as the mode.
Configure the rule to use the "Enpal Solar Surplus Meter" you just created.
Example Configuration for Surplus Charging Rule:

Meter: Enpal Solar Surplus Meter
Start Current: 6A (or your desired start current)
Stop Current: 0A (or your desired stop current)
Priority: High
Testing the Endpoint

You can test the endpoint using the curl command:

```bash
curl http://yourip:5000/solar_power_surplus
```

The expected response should reflect the calculated solar power surplus considering the battery status.

Troubleshooting

Ensure the Flask application is running and check the logs for any errors.
Ensure the server running the Flask application is accessible from the device running the cFos Charging Manager.
Ensure the JSON response from the Flask endpoint matches the expected format.
